# RC2TurretPatch
Patches the ISO file for Ratchet and Clank 2 (europe) to fix bouncing/bobbing Megaturrets when run on PCSX2.
This does not work with a disc, the game must be in the format of an ISO file.

# How to use
1. Install Python
2. Clone this repo
3. Run "RC2TurretPatch.py" and select the Ratchet and clank 2 ISO
4. When the program closes, the patch should be applied

# Disclaimer
This works in my own testing, but your results may be different. 
There is no reason to suspect any corrupted savefiles from this patch, but a backup of memorycards is adviced.
