# RC2TurretPatch
Patches the ISO file for Ratchet and Clank 2 (europe) to fix bouncing/bobbing Megaturrets when run on PCSX2.
This does not work with a disc, the game must be in the format of an ISO file.
The patch uses the same game id, and can therefore be applied at any point during your playthrough, with existing saves being fully functional

# How to use
1. Install Python
2. Clone this repo
3. Run "RC2TurretPatch.py" and select the Ratchet and clank 2 ISO
4. When the application closes, the patch should be applied

# Disclaimer
This works in my own testing, but your results may be different. 
There is no reason to suspect any corrupted savefiles from this patch, but a backup of memorycards is adviced.
While some testing has been carried out, there may still be bugs caused by this, that have not been found.
